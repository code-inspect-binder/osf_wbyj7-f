This repository contains code to estimate parameters of the SAT models reported in: 

Larson, J. S., & Hawkins, G. E. (submitted). Speed-accuracy tradeoffs in decision making: Perception shifts and goal activation bias decision thresholds.

This open source code is released under the license conditions listed on the OSF repository 
hosting the code (osf.io/wbyj7). Please cite the paper if you make use of the code.

The repository is designed to be downloaded as a complete zipped directory. 

The repository is divided by experiment. In each experiment, there is a set of .r files to estimate the four SAT models reported in the manuscript (threshold, sensitivity, non-decision time, null). Each of these files will estimate parameters of the file-named model for all conditions in the experiment (4 conditions in Experiment 1, 2 conditions in Experiment 2). The "modelFits" directory is a place holder to store the model output.
